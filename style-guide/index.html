    <h3>Stylistic Scope of this Document</h3>
    <p>This style guide limits its focus to the aspects of writing style that can be automated by publishing technology.  In particular technology responsible for implementing
    Web standards such as HTML, CSS, Mobile Web and Digital Publications (e.g. eBooks). The stylistical scope of this guide then covers primarily the visual style of text as
    seen by a reader and not the literary style of prose. The guide will go beyond describing best practices for the appearance of text in some cases; such as to describe
    best practices for the syntax of written symbols.  Simple syntactic rules for punctuation can be evaluated by word processing applications without requiring the analysis of
    words under their part of speach or in their role shaping grammar.</p>

    <h3>Relationship to <em>Ethiopic Layout Requirements</em></h3>
    </section>

<!--
<p> In addition to the Ethiopian and Eritrean homelands, the script is widely used througout the diaspora of these two nations. Accordingly, requirements are gathered from stakeholders engaged in Ethiopic publishing from all regions.</p>
    <p>The document does not describe implementations or issues related to specific technologies, such as CSS. Instead it describes the typographic requirements of Ethiopic in a technology-agnostic manner, so that the content remains evergreen and is equally relevant to all technologies that aim to represent Ethiopic text on the Web.</p>

    <h3>How this Document was Created</h3>
    <p>This document was created by the W3C Ethiopic Layout Task Force.  The Task Force will discuss many issues and harmonize the recommendations from writer and publisher communities</p>
    <p>The following types of experts will be involved in the creation of this document:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Experts from the publishing industry representing the spectrum of traditional to modern layout practices.</li>
      <li>Ethiopian and Eritrean author and language associations.</li>
      <li>Ethiopic typography experts.</li>
      <li>Academic experts with a focus on  manuscripts, philogy and digitization.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Task Force will translate a draft of the style guide and circulate it in the publishing industry as well as among writer and language focused organizations. A workshop is planned to review responses and arrive at resolutions to support all perspectives on style under the guide.</p>

      <h4>Single quotation marks next to double quotation marks</h4>
      <p>When single quotation marks are nested within double quotation marks, and two of the marks appear next to each other, a space between the two marks, though not strictly required, aids legibility. For print publications, typesetters may place a thin space or a hair space between the two marks (as in the print edition of this manual). In electronic environments (including manuscripts submitted for publication), a nonbreaking space can be used (as in the online edition of this manual); such a space will prevent the second mark from becoming stranded at the beginning of a new line.</p>

      for denoting decimal values, forming an ellipsis, and in single word abbreviations (see XX, YY, ZZ).

      <h4>Use of the question mark</h4>
      <p>The question mark in Ethiopian literature is used as it is internationally. Its primaray use is
         to indicate that the statement leading up to the mark is a direct question.  It may also be used
         for a rhetorical question, to indicate doubt, disbelief, or a level of factual uncertainity of a
         statement.</p>
      <p>An archaic question mark written with three vertical dots (፧) can be found in some legacy works.
         While the mark is recognized internationally as the "Ethiopic Question Mark" its use should be
         reserved strictly for the reproduction of materials that have employed it, and not as a substitute
         for the regular question mark in any new works.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="h_punctuation_question_marks_in_relation" class="ok">
      <h4>Question marks in relation to surrounding text and punctuation</h4>
      <p>Question marks should be placed within any circumfix punctuation marks such as quotation marks,
         parenthesis and brackets.  As a device for emphasis, a question mark may follow some other punctuation,
         specifically another question mark, an exclamation point, or an ellipsis.
         A question mark should replace, and not follow the Ethiopic wordspace.

         Double quotes, in directional “smart” styling, may be used when guillemets are not available to a writer,
         but should otherwise be avoided. Favoring guillemets over quotation marks is both in keeping with

      <p>Apostrophe (’) is an important symbol to modern Tigrinya that is applied between
      words in a contraction. If the second word begins with a vowel, it will be dropped. Apostrophe is then
      thought of as taking the place of a silent vowel.  No other use of apostrophe in the Ethiopic context is known.</p>

         use either space as the document space.
      <p>Like the western space, Ethiopic wordspace is not punctuation per se, but plays a similar if more fundamental role.
         Both are used as a separator between words, however special rules apply when the Ethiopic wordspace would precede or 
         follow punctuation and numerals. These special rules will be reviewed in the following subsections.</p>

      <p>Lists with item markers are a common practice found in modern Ethiopic writing.  Lists may be ordered where the sequence is important and applies a “counter” that is numerical using either Ethiopic or Arabic numerals, or alphabetical applying the Ethiopic syllabary in keeping with the language of the document.  Unordered lists are also used applying basic geometrical shapes such as circles and squares, solid or hollow, or more decorative shapes at the author’s discretion. Lists may be formatted vertically, vertically and multi-level, or inline (AKA “run-in”) and single level.</p>

      <p>Style guides provide recommendations for the logical grouping of items within a list and for forming the phrases of the listed items and detail rules for their internal punctuation. In this section we focus only on formatting and positioning rules that computer software would automate for an author. List discussed here are lists that occur in text and does not apply to table of contents, lists of illustrations, lists of tables, glossaries or indexes.  These more specific kinds of lists are discussed in other sections.</p>

      <h4>Run-in versus vertical lists</h4>
      <p>Two list layout orientations can be used. A list maybe laid out vertically, in a new paragraph with one list item per line. A list may also be presented horizontally within a sentence (known as “run-in” or “inline” lists).  Run-in lists are more appropriate when the listed items are relatively short and the list forms a sentence with the introductory text (see <a href="#h_punctuation_lists_run_ins_lists"></a>).  List where the items may be longer phrases or full sentences, or have multiple levels, should be set vertically (see <a href="#h_punctuation_lists_vertical_lists_punctuated"></a>).</p>

      <p>When letters or Ethiopic numerals are used to mark the items in a run-in list they should be followed by a slash, “/”. If western numbers are used

  <h2>Emphasis</h2>
    <p>Emphasis can be expressed in a number of common approaches such as italics, boldface and underscore which maintain the
       same underlying typeface.  In past eras that predate digital publishing, a change in the font size as well as to the
       underlying typeface, are more common approaches. This section provides guidance on applying the various approaches to
       emphasis.</p>
    <section id="h_emphasis_reproduction" class="ok">
    <h3>Emphasis in republished works</h3>
       <p>When a pre-digital or early digital work is reproduced with modern software, it is recommended that the style of emphasis
       used in the original work be preserved in the updated form. Unless it can be determined that a particular style of emphasis
       because a technical limitation did not allow for a preferred style of emphasis to be employed.  In this case the change of
       emphasis style would be acceptable as it reflects the intent of the author.  For example, underlined text should not be changed
       to italics in a republishing of a work unless it is known that the author had desired italics emphasis but it was unavailable
       at the time.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="h_emphasis_italic" class="ok">
    <h3>Italics for emphasis</h3>

    </section>
    <section id="h_emphasis_boldface" class="ok">
    <h3>Boldface for emphasis</h3>
       <p>In works using the classic, heavy typeface, bold emphasis should not be used as it can be difficult to
       distinguish from the regular weight. An exception is found when a classic typeface is specifically designed for the bold
       appearance, in which case it is most suitable for chapter and section titles.</p>
       <p>In works using a modern, thinner weight, typefaces, emboldened text may be used effectively for emphasis and is most
       appropriate for chapter and section titles. When the typeface
       used to render a document will be unknown, boldface should be avoided emphasis in favor of underline or italics.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="h_emphasis_underscore" class="ok">
    <h3>Underscore for emphasis</h3>
       <p>Underscore (also called “underline”) is a more appropriate form of emphasis for the classic weight typeface and has some
       historic precedence in Ethiopic publishing, particularly where only a single typeface was available. When a document uses underscore for a
       special purpose, such as to denote a the presence of a hyperlink, underscore should then be avoided in favor of italics.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="h_emphasis_inline_size_change" class="ok">
    <h3>Size change for emphasis</h3>
       <p>In works where only a single typeface could be used, emphasis expressed mid-sentence is sometimes shown by enlarging the font size by around 25%
       of the regular height.  Increasing the text size is sometimes used as an alternative to boldface or in a way analogous to “All Caps” in western
       writing.  The approach should primarily be used only when reproducing a work where it has been applied in the original publication.
       Text size change may used cautiously when it has been determined that another form of emphasis is unsuitable.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="h_emphasis_manuscript_typeface" class="ok">
    <h3>Typeface change for emphasis</h3>
       <p>In some older, pre-digital, works emphasis can be shown by changing the typeface from the classic (“Zemen”) style to an even older
       style as would be found in manuscripts and early mechanical publishing.  The typeface style change might also be accompanied by a
       change in text height.  It is recommended that this approach only be used only when reproducing a work where it has been applied in the
       original publication. The change to a manuscript style typeface can be used in lieu of a suitable italic typeface.</p>

      <h3>Languages Using the Latin Alphabet</h3>
    <section id="relative_character_heights">
      <h4>Relative Character Heights</h4>
      <p>In multilingual documents, differences between the heights of letters in Ethiopic script and its companion foreign script are often found.
        The difference is likely an artifact of the typesetting technology in use and does not represent the intent of the author or publisher.
        In the classic typeface style of Ethiopic script the letters will be of variable heights. Fixed height styles are more generally used for
        advertisement and not publishing. The nature of variable height Ethiopic letters is a factor that complicates how to  best align letter height with a foreign script.</p>
      <figure id="comparative_heights_latn_ethi"> <img src="../images/English-Ethiopic-Relative-Heights-With-Guide-Lines.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Comparative heights of English and Ethiopic script.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>At a given point size, letter heights within a script may vary widely between typefaces. This adds another level of difficulty
        to aligning heights between scripts as an alignment will only be optimal between a specific typeface pair. Within a script featuring variable
        (not fixed) height letters the relative heights of letters are subject to change between typefaces. This phenomena reinforces the
        previous assertion on typeface pair optimization, but also introduces the possibility that alignment optimization can be language
        sensistive. This happens when an alignment pair designed for the letter inventory of one language is applied to another language
        that includes letters that exceed the heights of the optimized set. </p>
      <p> With these caveats considered, “Zen” alignment is a means to optimize an Ethiopic-Latin typeface pair that is suitable for a general
        use case when priori knowledge of a document language is unknown. Its basis is reviewed here.
        The Latin letter “Z” and Ethiopic letter “<span lang="am">ን</span>” are chosen as pairing symbols representative of the mean height.  They both feature broad
        horizontal strokes that are easy for the eye to follow as a nearly continuous stroke.
      <p> A better approach is to align Z with caron (Ž) against <span lang="am">ን</span> with marcon <span lang="am">(ኝ)</span> while aligning and Z with <span lang="am">ን</span> and find typefaces with a good tuple of aligned pairings.</p>

    <section id="relative_typeface_weights">
      <h4>Relative Typeface Weights</h4>
      <p>A common practice in Ethiopic literature is the change of typeface weight in one script to appear more visually similar to the other.
        Most typically a Latin typeface will be made heavier to better match its Ethiopic counterpart.  This weight increase is demonstrated in many
        Ethiopic fonts that include  Latin letters. The font designer may have increased the weight of the Latin range primarily to provide heavier
        weight punctuation to use with Ethiopic script (see <a href="#ethiopicized_punctuation">Ethiopicized Punctuation</a>).</p>
      <p>Literature produced with a heavier Latin typeface may represent the author’s stylistic sensibilities but in some cases may  only be a
        pragmatic outcome when an author finds manually changing between fonts too burdensome. 
        The view of professional publishers is unknown here and should be determined.</p>

      <h4>Baseline Alignment</h4>
      <p>It is not uncommon to observe mid-sentence baseline changes in interlingual documents produced with pre-digital typesetting systems
         where Ethiopic and Latin text, for example, would appear to be laid out along different baselines in a line of text.  The most common
         example of this appears in documents produced with a typewriter where a sheet of paper had to be moved between typewriters to produce
         a line in two scripts.  An apparent baseline difference here would be the result of mechanical misalignment.</p>

       <p><em>Note: The only point that seems can be made here would be to state that Ethiopic and foreign scripts should share the same baseline.  This
              may already be the case with computer typography.  If so, this section should be removed.</em></p>

       westernn numerals are the clear choice for phone numbers, fractions, decimal number and other calculated quantities.
       While literature in the Ge’ez language should preclude the use of western numerals.  Cardinal numbers used for
       counting chapters and page numbers may use either system with Ethiopic being the preferred.</p>
