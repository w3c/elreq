    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section id="purpose">
    <h3>Purpose of this Document</h3>
    <p>This document describes requirements of the layout and presentation of text in the Ethiopic script for use with Web standards and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Mobile Web and Digital Publications (e.g. eBooks). In addition to the Ethiopian and Eritrean homelands, the script is widely used througout the diaspora of these two nations. Accordingly, requirements are gathered from stakeholders engaged in Ethiopic publishing from all regions.</p>
    <p>The document does not describe implementations or issues related to specific technologies, such as CSS. Instead it describes the typographic requirements of Ethiopic in a technology-agnostic manner, so that the content remains evergreen and is equally relevant to all technologies that aim to represent Ethiopic text on the Web.</p>

    <h3>How this Document was Created</h3>
    <p>This document was created by the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/elreq/">W3C Ethiopic Layout Task Force</a>.  The Task Force will discuss many issues and harmonize the requirements from user communities and solutions from technological experts.</p>
    <p>The following types of experts will be involved in the creation of this document:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ethiopic typography experts.</li>
      <li>Experts from the publishing industry representing the spectrum of traditional to modern layout practices.</li>
      <li>Academic experts with a focus on <a href="#term.geez" class="termref">Ge’ez</a> manuscripts and philogy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Task Force will conduct a survey of the publishing industry to solicit input and identify the set of in-use layout styles. This document will then represent the normalized results of the industry survey which in turn becomes a basis for its validity and suitability to purpose. In the interim before to the survey results have been compiled and applied to this document, tentative specifications will be given based on the most-probable survey results anticipated from participating experts. <span class="note">Survey Pending</span> notes will appear along side specification sections to denote their status.</p>

    <h3>Basic Principles for Document Development</h3>
    <p>Growing out of the 182 element Ge’ez language syllabary for two millenia, Ethiopic in its present day form is a multilingual, and multinational, script comprised by 494 symbols representing: syllables, numerals, punctuation and tonal marks.  Numerous linguistic, cultural, literary, historical and political issues surround the script and its utilization -all of which the authors strive to avoid discussing unless directly relevant to clarifying a given layout use case. The following principles are applied in the development of this document:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>View publishers as the primary stakeholders.</li>
      <li>Attempt a “90% solution” where the common and primary needs of publishers are addressed. Important but less widely used practices such as for <a href="#term.yaredic-zaima-notation" class="termref">Yaredic Zaima Notation</a> will be addressed at a future time.</li>
      <li>It does not cover every issue of Ethiopic typography, but only the import differences from the Western language systems.</li>
      <li>The technical aspects of actual implementation are not covered by this document.</li>
      <li>In order to help readers’ understanding of how Ethiopic is used, typical real life examples are provided.</li>
      <li>Text layout rules and recommendations for readable design are different things, however these two issues are difficult to discuss independently. In this document, these two aspects are carefully separated. The aesthetic design recommendations are mainly described using notes.</li>
      <li>The main target of this document is common books. The authors’ experiences are mainly related to common books, and the quality required for common books is the highest in the market. There are many kinds of books in the market, and the requirements are quite diverse. The task force has a lot of accumulated experience in requirements and solutions for Ethiopic text composition. Nonetheless, many issues, which have been discussed over a long period of time, are applicable for other kinds of publication.</li>
      <li>In terms of frequency of use, the importance of magazines, technical manuals, and Web documents rates alongside common books. However, there are several characteristics in these publications, which are different from common books. These issues should be treated more fully in future documents.</li>

  <section id="ethiopic_eras">
    <h3>In-Scope Publishing Eras</h3>
    <p>While Ethiopic documents can be characterized under a number of time periods, we discern only two gross eras herein. <a href="#term.classical-ethiopic" class="termref">Classical Ethiopic</a> encompases the layout requirements found in the documents of the first printing presses and coming into fruition under the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie.  While not the focus of this document, “Classical Ethiopic” also encompasses handwritten manuscripts whose practices are present in early publishing. This era is characterized more by the influences of the Ge’ez tradition as embodied by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church with respect to spelling conventions, syntax and punctuation use, <a href="#term.wordspace" class="termref">Ethiopic Wordspace</a> and numeral system preference. Also featuring less variation in layout practice which is likely the result of having fewer publishing houses in operation.</p>
    <p>The Classical Ethiopic era is followed by <a href="#term.modern-ethiopic" class="termref">Modern Ethiopic</a> spanning from the post-Imperial period up until the present day. Modern Ethiopic practices are characterized by looser spelling conventions, the preference change toward whitespace and western numerals, more variation in layout styles  and in some cases limitations imposed by desktop publishing software designed for Western markets.</p>
    <p>The focus of this document is on the Modern Ethiopic layout conventions with distinctions pertaining to Classical Ethiopic noted when known.  An exception will be a complication that the authors hope to resolve found in Classical era documents where Ethiopic Wordspace interplays with Whitespace in a number of contexts.</p>

    <h3>Interlingual Documents with Ethiopic</h3>
    <!-- Discuss: Any considerations for when foreign scripts (Latin, Arabic, etc) are used with Ethiopic text. Relative character heights and weights.-->
    <section id="relative_character_heights">
      <h4>Relative Character Heights</h4>
      <p>In multilingual documents, differences between the heights of letters in Ethiopic script and its companion foreign script are often found.
        The difference is likely an artifact of the typesetting technology in use and does not represent the intent of the author or publisher.
        In the classic typeface style of Ethiopic script the letters will be of variable heights. Fixed height styles are more generally used for
        advertisement and not publishing. The nature of variable height Ethiopic letters is a factor that complicates how to  best align letter height with a foreign script.</p>
      <figure id="comparative_heights_latn_ethi"> <img src="images/English-Ethiopic-Relative-Heights-With-Guide-Lines.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Comparative heights of English and Ethiopic script.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>At a given point size, letter heights within a script may vary widely between typefaces. This adds another level of difficulty
        to aligning heights between scripts as an alignment will only be optimal between a specific typeface pair. Within a script featuring variable
        (not fixed) height letters the relative heights of letters are subject to change between typefaces. This phenomena reinforces the
        previous assertion on typeface pair optimization, but also introduces the possibility that alignment optimization can be language
        sensistive. This happens when an alignment pair designed for the letter inventory of one language is applied to another language
        that includes letters that exceed the heights of the optimized set. </p>
      <figure id="comparative_height_typeface"> <img src="images/Z-Reference-Monotype.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Comparative letter heights.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The relative heights of letters used in different languages may also change with typeface as this next figure illustrates. </p>
      <figure id="comparative_height_blin_tigrinya"> <img src="images/Z-Reference-Abyssinica.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Comparative letter heights change with typeface, <span lang="am">ቕ</span> of Blin and Tigrinya now exceeds the heights of Amharic.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> With these caveats considered, “Zen” alignment is a means to optimize an Ethiopic-Latin typeface pair that is suitable for a general
        use case when priori knowledge of a document language is unknown. Its basis is reviewed here.
        The Latin letter “Z” and Ethiopic letter “<span lang="am">ን</span>” are chosen as pairing symbols representative of the mean height .  They both feature broad
        horizontal strokes that are easy for the eye to follow as a nearly continuous stroke.
        Ethiopic letters that were introduced as an extension to the Ge’ez core will  typically feature a macron or other modifier at the top of
        a base letter in order to form the extension letter. The macron necessarily extends the height of a letter.  Using the top of the macron
        for the reference height of a letter leads to height alignment that makes the majority of Ethiopic letters appear too short against Latin letters. </p>
      <figure id="align_top_symbol"> <img src="images/Z-Ny-N-Top-Aligned.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Alignment and top of symbols (Ethiopic letters too squat).</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> A better approach is to align Z with caron (Ž) against <span lang="am">ን</span> with marcon <span lang="am">(ኝ)</span> while aligning and Z with <span lang="am">ን</span> and find typefaces with a good tuple of aligned pairings.</p>
      <figure id="align_below_accent"> <img src="images/Z-caron-Ny-Z-N-Alignment.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Alignment below accent (better sizing).</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Going further, we may assume that the <span lang="am">ኝ</span> and Ž will align satisfactorily (optionally check any irregularities) and simply align the Z-<span lang="am">ን</span> pair.
        Phonetically the sequence of these two letters would sound like “zen”, hence the name.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Does Z-<span lang="am">ን</span> alignment seem reasonable?</li>
          <li>If not Z-<span lang="am">ን</span> alignment, what Ethiopic letter should be applied as a height reference point for alignment? Or what other height alignment basis should be used?</li>
          <li>Should height alignment be attempted as per the letter inventory of a target language or for the script as a whole (practical but less optimal)?</li>
          <li>Relative to a Latin uppercase letter, should the height of Ethiopic letters: (a) equal (b) shorter (c) taller?</li>
          <li>Is height alignment an issue with other writing systems?  If so, how is it addressed?</li>

    <section id="relative_typeface_weights">
      <h4>Relative Typeface Weights</h4>
      <p>A common practice in Ethiopic literature is the change of typeface weight in one script to appear more visually similar to the other.
        Most typically a Latin typeface will be made heavier to better match its Ethiopic counterpart.  This weight increase is demonstrated in many
        Ethiopic fonts that include  Latin letters. The font designer may have increased the weight of the Latin range primarily to provide heavier
        weight punctuation to use with Ethiopic script (see <a href="#ethiopicized_punctuation">Ethiopicized Punctuation</a>).</p>
      <p>Literature produced with a heavier Latin typeface may represent the author’s stylistic sensibilities but in some cases may  only be a
        pragmatic outcome when an author finds manually changing between fonts too burdensome. 
        The view of professional publishers is unknown here and should be determined.</p>
      <div class="issues">
        <p>Issues/Questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>When publishing in the classical Ethiopic weight, should English words appear in their default English weight?</li>
          <li>If heavier Latin letters are desirable, how much so? Can a weight increase be defined as a percentage of the Ethiopic?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="baseline_alignment">
      <h4>Baseline Alignment</h4>
      <p>It is not uncommon to observe mid-sentence baseline changes in interlingual documents produced with pre-digital typesetting systems
         where Ethiopic and Latin text, for example, would appear to be laid out along different baselines in a line of text.  The most common
         example of this appears in documents produced with a typewriter where a sheet of paper had to be moved between typewriters to produce
         a line in two scripts.  An apparent baseline difference here would be the result of mechanical misalignment.</p>

       <p><em>Note: The only point that seems can be made here would be to state that Ethiopic and foreign scripts should share the same baseline.  This
              may already be the case with computer typography.  If so, this section should be removed.</em></p>

  <section id="sebatbeit_glyph_preferences">
    <h3>Sebatbeit Glyph Preferences</h3>
    <p>The Sebatbeit (aka Sebat Bet) language features a greater number and frequency of labiovelarized letter forms in comparison to the larger
       language communities utilizing Ethiopic script.  In Sebatbeit publishing a number of modifications to diacritical marks are regularly
       applied to aid glyph clarity.  These modified glyphs will sometimes appear within in font as a <em>Stylistic Alternative</em> or an
       entirely separate font may be used in publishing where these letter shapes appear as the default forms.  The glyphs are enumerated here and
       are recommended for Sebatbeit literature.</p>

  <section id="punctuation">
  <h3>Punctuation</h3>
  <section id="ethiopic_punctuation">
    <h4>Punctuation Used in Ethiopic</h4>
    <p>In Classical era Ethiopic up to nine punctuation marks can be found. Though rarely, if ever, would all nine be found in a single document.
       The Classical Ethiopic punctuation inventory may <em>appear</em> to be larger in number as a result of bi-chromatic rendering which can be
       applied to any punctuation and in several different styles.  However, the bi-chromatic forms do not change the syntactic role of a given
       punctuation.  In the Modern era, a third of the punctuation marks: <span lang="am">፧</span>, <span lang="am">፨</span>, and <span lang="am">፠</span> have largely fallen into disuse while a number of punctuation
       marks from Western practices have been adopted. Bi-chromatic punctuation is now reserved for spiritual materials and remains a calligraphic practice.</p>
    <p>Ethiopic punctuation segments text and is non-enclosing. 
       The Ethiopic word separator, labeled “Ethiopic Wordspace” in the Unicode standard, is given special attention in this section as follows more
       complex rules of interaction with other punctuation as well as justification.  Ethiopic punctuation is often aligned with similar English
       punctuation though these associations must be understood as approximate.  Ethiopic fullstop and wordspace are highly regular in their application,
       others, particularly <span lang="am">፣</span>, <span lang="am">፤</span>, and <span lang="am">፥</span> will be consistently used within a document but their roles may change between authors or institutes.  A detailed
       review of punctuation semantics is beyond the scope of this document, however Ethiopic comma is given special attention in the following section.</p>
    <p>The following descriptions of Ethiopic punctuation usage has been translated from Gebre and Shewaye.</p>

       Expressive punctuation such as question mark, exclamation point, inverted exclamation mark, and ellipsis are also incorporated into Ethiopic practices. 
       Additional foreign symbols that denote currency, time, mathematics, or communicate with Internet protocols (e.g. "@" , "://") have also
       been adopted as over the last century as international communication grew.</p>
    <p>The ES-781:2002 standard identifies the following inventory of western symbols to be used with Ethiopic:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px"><code>1234567890 ? ! ¡ . / () [] {} &lt; = &gt; \ # % &amp; _ - + ± × ÷ ‘ ’ “ ” ‹ › « »</code></p>
    <p>Additionally the following punctuation is observed to be used with Ethiopic writing:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px"><code>$ : , € @ …</code></p>
    <p>Inverted exclamation mark is repurposed and utilized differently than in its Western usage.
       In Ethiopic writing the inverted exclamation mark is known as “Timirte Slaq” (<span lang="am">ትእምርተ፡ሥላቅ</span>) appears at the end of
       a sentence and will denote sarcasm. All borrowed punctuation is subject to typeface alignment with Ethiopic weights and shapes, an aesthetic
       enhancement discussed in this section as <a href="#ethiopicized_punctuation">“Ethiopicized Punctuation”</a>.</p>

    <h4>Ethiopic Comma Usage</h4>
      <p>In Ethiopic writing practices three encoded symbols will be used in the context of comma, however they are generally not used together.
         Looked at another way, the Ethiopic comma may appear with three different glyphs. The western comma also has an important role in Ethiopic writing.
         Usage rules are as follows:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt lang="am">፣ - ነጠላ ሠረዝ</dt>
        <dd><span class="uname">U+1363 ETHIOPIC COMMA</span> <span lang="am">(አማ/ ነጠላ ሠረዝ, ትግ/ ንጽል ሰረዝ)</span> is used as a comma in Ethiopian practices and as a semicolon in Eritrea. “<span lang="am">፣</span>” will also be
              used in Ge’ez writing as a semicolon (is this a modern usage or classic?).
              <span class="uname">U+1364 ETHIOPIC SEMICOLON</span>, <span lang="am">፤</span>, in turn is used as a colon in Eritrean writing (verify).</dd>
        <dt lang="am">፥ - ንዑስ ሠረዝ</dt>
        <dd><span class="uname">U+1365 ETHIOPIC COLON</span> in contrast to its Unicode name, is never used as a colon in any known Ethiopic practices.
              Rather, it is a classical glyph variant of <span class="uname">U+1364 ETHIOPIC SEMICOLON</span> <span lang="am">(፣)</span>. <span lang="am">፥</span> is the default comma glyph in Ge’ez writing and is the preferred
              comma glyph by some modern writers writing in other languages. <span lang="am">፥</span> is the default comma in most Amharic bibles, likely in keeping with
              the Ge’ez Bible that the Amharic would have been translated from.  Some modern Bible translations into Amharic, as well as other religious
              literature, will use <span lang="am">፣</span> as the default comma in prose but maintain <span lang="am">፥</span> for passage references, e.g. <span lang="am">ማቴ4፥23 , ዮሐ13፥16 ,</span> etc. Given this
              common usage in religious materials “ecclesiastical comma” is a practical English term for referring to the <span lang="am">፥</span> glyph variant. 
              As mentioned already, writing experts Desta Tekle Wold, Kidane Wolde Kifle, Dereje Gebre, and Tesfaye Shewaye all attest to the equivalence of the two symbols.</dd>
        <dt lang="am">፡ - ንዑስ ነጥብ</dt>
        <dd><span class="uname">U+1361 ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> <span lang="am">(አማ/ ሁለት ነጥብ, ትግ/ ክልተ ነጥቢ)</span> in keeping with Ge’ez heritage, is used as the word separator (i.e. space) in the classical writing practices
              of both Eritrean and Ethiopia.  In modern Eritrean writing practices <span class="uname">ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> will be used in the role of a comma (illustrated in Figure <a href="#ecclesiastical_emphasis_sample"></a>).
              When used in modern Ethiopian writing, it retains its classic role as word separator (space).
              See <a href="#wordspace_in_comma_context"></a> for elaboration on this topic. </dd>

      <h4>Ethiopic Wordspace in the Context of Comma</h4>
      <p>In recent decades some communities have adopted a practice of employing the wordspace symbol as a comma when <span class="uname">U+0020 SPACE</span> [ ] is used as the word separator. The interpretation of the symbol is then dependent on the context of the writing convention in use by the author. Accordingly, an application user setting could be offered to set the symbol context.</p>
      <p>An alternative view point on this practice is that <span class="uname">U+1363 ETHIOPIC COMMA</span> [<span lang="am">፣</span>] is in fact in use by these user communities; however its glyph has decayed whereby the line segment is lost and so it visually coincides with <span class="uname">U+1361 ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [<span lang="am">፡</span>].  Under this perspective, a simple solution would be modify an Ethiopic font for these users (perhaps adding an alternative glyph in an OpenType stylistic set) where the Ethiopic comma character address and semantics remain intact though the visual form has been tailored to meet aesthetic needs. </p>

Doing so simplifies spacing rules for the Wordspace symbol as the comma usage context will not need to be addressed.

      <p>It modern literature where punctuation may be borrowed from Western writing, inconsistent formatting practices are found with respect to the presence of Ethiopic Wordspace (<span lang="am">፡</span>) alongside borrowed punctuation. It is helpful to establish rules for Ethiopic Wordspace in the presence of other symbols so that software grammar and formatting checkers can offer corrections leading to better quality and more consistent literature. The following rules are proposed:</p>

      <p>The Ethiopic gemination mark, <span lang="am">ጥብቅ</span>, is almost universally found at a fixed height above the baseline in typeset literature. The mark’s position must
         then be fixed so that it remains above the tallest Ethiopic letter symbol; this produces a variable height gap between the top of the letter and the mark.
         Conversely, when the symbol is hand written (often above typeset text) the mark will be found at a variable height above the baseline and demonstrating
         a fixed height above the letter symbol.
         Quite possibly the former style is an artifact of a limitation of the layout technology employed, and the later representative of an author’s
         desired rendering.</p>

           may share a common upper and lower bar. Conceivably the joining style went out of favor as it proved more difficult to support in publishing technology. Modern
           preferences should be determined from stakeholders.</p>

      <h4>Justification When ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE is the Word Delimiter</h4>
      <p>Since the arrival of the printing press in Ethiopia in 1863 (Pankhurst, 1998), full justification of Ethiopic has been a common typesetting practice in Ethiopian, and later Eritrean, publishing houses. Earlier, Ethiopic justification rules are a feature of Hiob Ludolf’s Historia Æthiopica, which is noted as the first use of movable type for Ethiopic script (Ludolf, 1681). Prior to letterpress typography, calligraphic manuscripts rendered on parchment also featured full, or approximately full, justification. Though the latter likely reflects the scribe’s desire not to waste a millimeter of available lateral writing space.</p>
      <p>The placement of Ethiopic wordspace presents a complication to the justification of Ethiopic text. Two placement styles developed in typeset
        literature which will be referred to here as “word bound” and “centered” styles. Additionally, the word spacing following an Ethiopic fullstop
        may (or may not) be governed by a special rule and in combination with the two wordspace spacing styles. These spacing rules are discussed in the
        following sections.</p>

    <section id="justification_with_word_bound_wordspace">
      <h5>Justification with Word Bound Wordspace and Punctuation</h5>
      <p>In keeping with line justification for Latin script, the non-printed or “blank space” (space and gaps) between words is treated as stretchable. The width of the space symbol itself will be elongated to some aesthetic width value that may vary from space symbol to space symbol across a printed line. In Ethiopic justification, the blank space between the Ethiopic word separator and the words it separates is likewise allowed to stretch. This stretching of blank space may be either symmetrical (“centered”) or asymmetrical but in the latter case space stretching is always between the right side of the separator and the following word –referred to here as “word bound”. </p>
      <p>In  “word bound”  justification  the  word  separator,   which  may  be  either  a  punctuation  symbol  or <span class="uname">U+1361 ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [<span lang="am">፡</span>], appears to adhere to the word to the left as if it were its final character. Figures <a href="#justification_word_bound"></a> and <a href="#justification_in_historia_aethiopica"></a> both illustrate the word bound style.</p>

      <p>In the second major form of Ethiopic justification the blank space around word separators is stretched equally on both the left and right sides; giving the appearance of the separator being centered between the words it divides. <a href="#fig_justification_centered"></a> depicts the "centered wordspace" justification style, which applies equally for other punctuation.</p>

In a second mode, the Ethiopic full stop will have special spacing rules applied to it whereby more separation space is allowed following the symbol and the start of the next word.  In a sense, the right side space of the full stop is “more elastic” than in the regular mode.  The elasticity rule and the visual effect are similar to that of the final line of a fully justified paragraph in Western text.  When the final line of a paragraph of Latin script crosses a certain horizontal threshold, the line will become fully justified. Below that threshold the line will appear left aligned.  The same rule appears to be applied to the Ethiopic full stop but on any line of the paragraph.  An illustration of this sub-mode is depicted in the following: </p>

      <h5>Shortcomings Found in Electronic Typesetting Systems</h5>
      <p>To date, computer software that typesets text has applied justification rules for blank space stretching that were designed to meet publishing requirements in the Western world. When the same rules are applied to Ethiopic text, the results are unsatisfactory as they do not meet user expectations. Largely responsible for the formatting dissonance when Western justification is applied to Ethiopic text, is the absence of a white space symbol in the writing system. There is no explicit white space symbol (in classic Ethiopic writing) to be “stretched”.</p>
       <p>Formatting algorithms will then process <span class="uname">U+1361 ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [<span lang="am">፡</span>] as a punctuation symbol where word enclosing rules, rather than word spacing rules, will be applied. While still stretchable, “white space” in the Ethiopic wordspace is implicit rather than explicit. For a complete solution, software will ultimately need to be enhanced to stretch implicit space as required. Reclassifying the Ethiopic wordspace as a “Zs” symbol is expected to help alleviate justification issues and clears the way for software firms to implement comprehensive support for Ethiopic justification. Since the Ethiopic wordspace interferes with justification in present day software, authors may opt not to use it or may “pad” wordspace and Ethiopic punctuation with explicit white space to produce the desired justification style (i.e. <a href="#justification_with_word_bound_wordspace">Word Bound</a> or <a href="#justification_with_centered_wordspace">Centered</a>). To properly render text formatted in this way, future “wordspace aware” software, should elide spaces bordering Ethiopic wordspace and punctuation when producing justified text.</p>
      <p>The following samples depict formatting of Kidane Wolde Kifle’s seminal work <cite>Maṣḥafa Sawāsew</cite> with a popular word processor (Kifle, 1955 (1948 EC)) under the limitations of Western spacing rules justification.</p>

      <p>In digital documents such as in web pages and eBooks, it is recommended that the appearance of either <span class="uname">U+0020 SPACE</span> [ ] or <span class="uname">U+1361 ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [<span lang="am">፡</span>] be configurable as a user preference. An easy to access “space” toggle button would enhance a viewing application’s usability.</p>

      <h3>First Paragraph Rule</h3>
      <p>Paragraph indentation is a regular practice in Ethiopic publishing, and not common in hand written manuscripts where a Hareg (<span lang="am">ሐረግ</span>) or Mekfel (<span lang="am">መክፈል</span>)
         will be used instead. Some Western publishers will apply a special rule whereby the first paragraph of a section is not indented. The same
         rule can be found applied in Ethiopic publications, however, the adoption appears to be limited.</p>

        keeping with the later style.  The former style (left justified at counter) may reflect a limitation of the
        layout technology employed and not a preference of the author, copy editor or typesetter. A depiction of these
        two alignment styles is presented in the following figures:</p>

      is most likely a matter of convenience for the author and not necessarily representative of good formatting.</p>

      <h4>Abegede (<span lang="am">አበገደ</span>) Lists</h4>
      <p>The <span lang="am">አበገደ</span> ordering of the Ethiopic syllabary is an alignment with the Coptic and Greek alphabets possibly to
         facilitate interdenominational communication or for the transfer of gematria practices.
         The ordering is used today largely for pedagogical purposes and has been used by some authors for the collation of
         entire works such as dictionaries. More often authors will apply the ordering for list orders.</p>
      <p>The አበገደ ordering is potentially desirable to any language using the Ethiopic syllabary.
         The ordering is less likely to be found in the writing practices of languages that have a written tradition of under a hundred years.
         The language specific orders shown here are only those found utilized in corpus.</p>

      <h3>Page Numbering</h3>
      <p>The layout and formatting of page and section numbering in Ethiopic practices does not demonstrate a marked difference from Western conventions. 
         Most often the page number itself will appear in the center footer position or in the outer header section, but may appear in any standard position.
         Page counting differences do need to be considered.</p>

        <figcaption>Page numbering in two systems from Metsehafe Chewata Sigawi by Zeneb Ethiopia.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In Ethiopic book publishing, the first numbered page will generally be seen on the <span lang="am">መቅድም</span> section. When a <span lang="am">መቅድም</span> section is not present,
         numbering is expected to begin at the <span lang="am">መግቢያ</span>. The prevailing Modern Ethiopic practice is to begin counting pages from the inner cover page (this
         is a matter of perception, by some views the outer cover is the first page and the inner cover, which is generally empty, is not counted). Thus the first printed
         number appearing at either the <span lang="am">መቅድም</span> or <span lang="am">መግቢያ</span> is not “1” (or “<span lang="am">፩</span>”) but the physical page count up to
         this point (for example “4” or “5”).</p>
      <p>At the author's discretion, either Western or Ethiopic numerals may be used for page numbers. In digital publishing, it is recommended that the a setting be offered
         the user to toggle the numeral system from the published default. Additionally, a tooltip that appears when focus is over an Ethiopic page number to present the Western
         numeral equivalent would be helpful for some readers.</p>

           out to either the <span lang="am">መቅድም</span> or <span lang="am">መግቢያ</span>. Prior to "page 1" preceding pages may be numbered in one of two ways.  In the first
           convention where pages are numbered with Ethiopic numerals, the preface numbering may be alphabetic in the <span lang="am">ሀለሐመ</span> counting system or in the
           <span lang="am">አበገደ</span> sequence (for example in Desta Tekle Wold's “<span lang="am">ዐዲስ፡ያማርኛ፡መዝገበ፡ቃላት።</span>”).</p>
        <p>In the second convention where pages are numbers with Western numerals, the preface page numbering will apply Ethiopic numerals.  Under both conventions the preface page
           number begins on the first printed page after the cover.</p>

    <h1>Alignment with HTML5 Layout &amp; Formatting</h1>
    <p>This appendix is introduced to help insure that the Ethiopic layout requirements in this recommendation has a sufficient and practical coverage in its scope.
       HTML5 is applied here for comparison as it is anticipated as the most frequently applied document language under which the recommendation will be applied.
       HTML5 elements will be reviewed in this appendix and remarks made to indicate that either: no recommendation is needed (western defaults are applicable),
       a document section is identified that covers the element in the Ethiopic context, or that a gap in coverage is identified and will be addressed.</p>
